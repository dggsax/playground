# Microphone Fun
Playing around to see if I can build a thread for micophone to live process fft.
This is built off of jodalyst's jinstrument github repo.

# For Carlos
Yo! So check out fft.py as this is barebones fft code. you make a class object, and then it can return an fft array, then from there you/we/joe/etc. can figure out how to do fft magic to then decide whether your guitar is tuned or not!
I'll outline in the email how to set everything up.

Love,

Gonzo
